# Fancy Text Formatter Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Background
On social media and messaging platforms, users often want to highlight their text using special effects such as bold, italic, serif, or sans-serif styles. Most platforms do not support rich text editing, so Unicode special characters are used to achieve these effects. Fancy Text Formatter aims to provide a convenient web tool for generating stylized English text with various font effects.

## 2. Product Goals
- Provide a simple and user-friendly web tool to convert regular English text into stylized text with different effects (Bold, Italic, Serif, Sans, and all four combinations).
- Support one-click copy for easy sharing on platforms like WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, etc.
- Ensure accurate conversion, a modern interface, and smooth user experience.
- Be extensible for more styles in the future.

## 3. Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (with React) for frontend and routing
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability
- **CSS3** (pure CSS, no external UI libraries) for styling
- **Unicode text transformation** (custom logic for text effects)

## 4. Core Features
1. **Text Input**: Users can input up to 2000 characters of English text.
2. **Style Conversion**: Automatically generate four stylized results:
   - Bold Serif
   - Bold Sans
   - Italic Serif
   - Italic Sans
3. **Character Support**: Support English letters, numbers, and common symbols. Non-letter characters are preserved.
4. **One-Click Copy**: Each result area has a copy button to copy the stylized text to the clipboard.
5. **Live Character Count**: Display the current character count and maximum limit below the input box.
6. **User Feedback**: Show friendly messages for empty input or copy failures.
7. **Extensibility**: The system should be designed to easily add more styles in the future.

## 5. UI Layout
- The top section contains a single text input box for user input.
- Below the input, there is a 2x2 grid layout displaying four result areas:
  - Top left: Bold Serif
  - Top right: Bold Sans
  - Bottom left: Italic Serif
  - Bottom right: Italic Sans
- Each result area displays the converted text and a copy button.
